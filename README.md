# react-asp.net-core-login
It contains react+redux+asp.netCore+EFCore+msSql and basic login. <br />
I will add more detail information about this repo asap. <br />
Basicaly, If you want to use react and asp.net core for services, you can check this repo. <br />
In addition, I added the login page which is served from backend. After successful login you got JWT token and redirecting to React side. <br />
React side is spa and has client side rendering. <br />
That kind of applications are called (isomorphic)
