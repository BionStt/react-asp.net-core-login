# react-asp.net-core-login
It contains react+redux+asp.netCore+EFCore+msSql and basic login.
I will add more detail information about this repo asap.
Basicaly, If you want to use react and asp.net core for services, you can check this repo. 
In addition, I added the login page which is served from backend. After successful login you got JWT token and redirecting to React side.
React side is spa and has client side rendering. 
That kind of applications are called "isomorphic"
